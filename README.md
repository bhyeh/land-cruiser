# Analzying My Dream Car! 

*"What does the UN, drug cartel, oil tycoons, and security forces have in common? They all drive a Toyota Land Cruiser"*

# Intro
I absolutely love classic 60 series Toyota Land Cruisers. They're boxy, rough looking, will go anywhere, and have the reputation to drive forever (until rust rots the frame). One of my favorite past times is browsing [Bring A Trailer](https://bringatrailer.com/toyota/land-cruiser-fj60-fj62/), an auction website for classic cars, and looking at Land Cruisers (LC) for sale. Though as a broke 22 year old college student and fortune-like prices for mint LC's – such as this beautiful blue FJ62 that bid for $35,850 – it's more of a spectator sport than anything else. However, I like to dream.

Even as an onlooker, from my time surfing listings I've gained a sense of what can make a Land Cruiser auction higher. For example, I've noticed West Coast cruisers are typically more valuable than East Coast as they've gone their lives without salted roads, a manual transmission is on any car enthusiasts dream check-list, and low mileage will especially grab a LC fanatics attention – just look at this [1,000 mile '94 80 series](https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1994-toyota-land-cruiser-fj80-24/) that sold for $136,000 with _2021 money_ (Yes, someone paid that much for a 27-year old SUV _and_ in this car market).

To that extent, I suspected there were serious underlying relationships between specific features of a LC and the ultimate price it would sell for.

# Analzying My Dream Car! 

*"What does the UN, drug cartel, oil tycoons, and private military contractors all have in common? They all drive a Toyota Land Cruiser"*

# Intro
I absolutely love classic 60 series Toyota Land Cruisers. They're boxy, rough looking, tough, and have the reputation to drive forever (until rust rots the frame and kills it). One of my favorite past times is surfing [Bring a Trailer](https://bringatrailer.com/toyota/land-cruiser-fj60-fj62/) and look at Land Cruisers (LC) for sale. Though as a broke 22 year old college student and prices going for _this_ beautiful blue LC at $35,850 - it's more of a spectator sport than anything else.

# Analzying My Dream Car! 

# Intro
I absolutely love old 60 series Toyota Land Cruisers. They're boxy, rough looking, and have the reputation to drive forever (until rust rots the frame and kills it). One of my favorite past times is surfing [BringaTrailer.com](https://bringatrailer.com/toyota/land-cruiser-fj60-fj62/) and look at current and past auctions.

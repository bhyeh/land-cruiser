# Analzying My Dream Car! 

*"What does the UN, drug cartel, oil tycoons, and security forces have in common? They all drive a Toyota Land Cruiser"*

# Intro
I absolutely love classic 60 series Toyota Land Cruisers. They're boxy, rough looking, will go anywhere, and have the reputation to drive forever (until rust rots the frame and kills it). One of my favorite past times is browsing [Bring a Trailer](https://bringatrailer.com/toyota/land-cruiser-fj60-fj62/), an auction website for classic cars, and looking at Land Cruisers (LC) for sale. Though as a broke 22 year old college student and fortune-like prices for mint LC's – such as this beautiful blue FJ62 that bid for $35,850 – it's more of a spectator sport than anything else. However, I like to dream.

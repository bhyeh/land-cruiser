# Analzying My Dream Car! 

*"What does the UN, drug cartel, oil tycoons, and the private security forces have in common? They all drive a Toyota Land Cruiser"*

# Intro
I absolutely love classic 60 series Toyota Land Cruisers. They're boxy, rough looking, will go anywhere, and have the reputation to drive forever. One of my favorite past times is browsing [Bring A Trailer](https://bringatrailer.com/toyota/land-cruiser-fj60-fj62/), an auction website for classic cars, and looking at Land Cruisers (LC) for sale. Though as a broke 22 year old college student and fortune-like prices for mint LC's – such as this beautiful blue FJ62 that bid and sold for $35,850 – it's more of a spectator sport than anything else. However, I like to dream.

Though even as an onlooker, from my time window-shopping I've actually gained a sense of what can attract higher bids for a Land Cruiser. For example, I've noticed West Coast cruisers are typically more valuable than East Coast as they've gone their lives without salted roads. A manual transmission seems to gather more interest as it is on any car enthusiasts dream check-list, and low mileage will especially grab a LC fanatic's attention – just look at this [1,000 mile '94 80 series](https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1994-toyota-land-cruiser-fj80-24/) that sold for $136,000 with _2021 money_ (Yes, someone actually paid that much for a 27-year old SUV).

To that extent, I suspected there were underlying relationships between specific features of a LC and the ultimate price it would sell for – and I wanted to put my intuitions to test.
